# Sales-Data-Analysis-Python

Dataset Used: Tiny SQLite Database (sales_data.db)

Tool Used: Python (with sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)

ðŸ”§ Project Features Implemented:

âœ… Database Creation & Management:

    Connected to and created a lightweight SQLite database (sales_data.db).
    Designed and populated a sales table with sample product sales data (quantity, price).

âœ… Data Extraction & Aggregation:

    Executed SQL queries directly from Python to aggregate sales information.
    Calculated total quantity sold and total revenue for each product.

âœ… Data Loading & Display:

    Utilized pandas to efficiently load SQL query results into a DataFrame.
    Printed the summarized sales data for quick review.

ðŸ“Š Visuals Created:

Bar Chart â€“ Total Revenue by Product:

    Generated a clear bar chart illustrating the total revenue contribution from each product (e.g., Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor).

    Provided a visual representation of product performance, making it easy to identify top revenue generators.

ðŸ§© Interactive Elements:

    This project is a foundational script for data analysis and visualization, focusing on core data processing and static chart generation. Therefore, no interactive elements or filters were implemented.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights Gained:

    Successfully extracted and summarized sales data from a raw database.
    Identified the total revenue for individual products.
    Demonstrated how to create a simple, informative bar chart to visualize key sales metrics.
    Gained practical experience in connecting Python with SQLite for basic data manipulation and visualization.
